Logic:

We know that if a set contains n elements then total possible combinations (subsets) of that sets are 2^(n).
We can represent the state of set with the index number. For eg: if we have (a,b,c), then 5th index number means
(1,0,1).

Now, we can adjust out program that if we contain 1 at nth bit then only print the value. Finding the nth index
is 1 or not we have discussed in the previous "Nth_Set_Bit" example. However, this program uses Logic:2 while calculating 
bit at nth index.
