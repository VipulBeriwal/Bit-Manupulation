Logic1:
We know that if a number is a power of two and if we subtract 1 from the number, all the bits become 1. Therefore if we perform
bitwise & of x and x-1, then the result will be zero. (0 is itself an exception)


Logic2:
If we take any number, subtract 1 from it, then, the bits after the rightmost one in x gets reversed including the one itself.
The left most bits will remain the same.
Ex -> 6 = 110
   -> 5 = 101
   
   -> 8 = 1000
   -> 7 = 0111
And if we perform bitwise & then, we will get the zero. (0 is itself an exception)
